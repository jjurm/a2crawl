## Inspiration
Pub crawls are great, but they're a faff to organise. Wouldn't it be great if there was an app for that? Well that is what we designed and developed. Based off of experiences we've all had of bad pub crawls we decided to take the human error out of it and hand it all over to our amazing algorithm.

## What it does
The use picks a start and end point, and distance they are willing to walk and then the algorithm will plan a pub crawl to all the best spots from A to B. It uses google's API and a python back end to find the optimal route around the best pubs near a given route, this is then fed to a front end UI which displays the users position and their personalised route.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It works really well and boy does it look swell, we think the UI is just amazing (obviosuly). We encountered some difficulties with the back end at about 7am and the sleep deprivation was surreal but we got through it all.

## What's next for DayTripper
Expanding this! Applying it to sight seeing, hiking and all sorts of other cool things you can do out and about. There are more features users want us to integrate too such as meeting people on their adventures and integrating Uber into the app so you can get home after you've had a few too many.
